Error connecting to remote server
--------------------------------------
ERROR: The WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication scheme is
     | different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport
     | must be used or the destination machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting. Use
     | winrm.cmd to configure TrustedHosts. Note that computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be
     | authenticated. You can get more information about that by running the following command: winrm help
     | config. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.

SOLUTION: On the machine you run SCC from, run the following command in Powershell
set-item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts -Concatenate -value 'hostname'
